# Fragmented Narratives

**A collaborative storytelling experience built one sentence at a time.**

Fragmented Narratives is an interactive web platform where users collectively create stories through sequential sentence contributions. Each narrative evolves through a unique blend of imagination, physical interaction, and collaborative creativity.

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Story Initialization**: Every story begins with a single opening sentence generated by the platform based on a chosen object.

2. **Sequential Contributions**: Each participant can add exactly one sentence to the story before passing it to the next user.

3. **Physical Exchange**: To contribute, participants must upload a photo showing themselves with the previous player and the designated story object.

4. **Fragmented Hints**: From the third sentence onward, only a random selection of 2-5 words from the previous sentence is shown to the next contributor, creating an element of mystery and creative interpretation.

5. **Story Completion**: Stories require at least nine contributions before they can be closed and fully revealed.

6. **History Archive**: Completed stories are available in the user's history for viewing and sharing.
